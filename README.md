## Service

 The service have three modules:

 - twilio : this is the twilio official local server
 - front: this is the service front page
 - web: this is the service web


### How to

 All there modules are independently running along side for now at development state. So to connect to twilio server, should open twilio server folder, and run it by ```npm start```.

 Twilio server will listen to 8081, so to change the app config is required as it used 3000 before.

 To check the front page, should open front folder, and run npm start, it will run at 3000.

 The web service was not used yet.
